# Linear-Regression-Alumni-donations
Alumni donations are critical to any modern university. It becomes important for administrators to assess the factors that influence them. In light of this critical requirement a dataset consisting of alumni donations, percentage of classes under twenty-students, student/faculty ratio and private/public indicator is analyzed to determine relevant influencing factors and the strength of their impact for nearly fifty Universities. Analysis of the data indicated a linear relationship between the variables and alumni donation, therefore a linear regression model developed to determine the relevant factors and their affect on donations. Every one unit of increase in student-faculty ratio leads to reduction of alumni giving rate by 2.05 and vice versa. All three variables are too closely correlated to capture any new information and hence only one is adequate for the purposes of the regression. Even though an adjusted R2   of 54% is indicative that there could be other factors outside the dataset that could be affecting alumni donation as nearly half of the variation in alumni donation is not being explained by the model, however student faculty ratio is one of the most directly controllable variables for a university, it may be adequate as a driver by itself to increase donations.
